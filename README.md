# PakSeek

PakSeek is a powerful and lightweight PAK file scanning and viewing tool built by **@AreyMadhav** in collaboration with **IDevSec**.
This tool allows you to quickly locate `.pak` files in a given directory, inspect their metadata, and prepare for future capabilities like extraction.

## Features

- Offline support — no internet connection required.
- Scan target folders for `.pak` files.
- Integrated custom window controls (no default OS title bar).
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Built with performance and portability in mind.

## Usage

### GUI Version
Simply launch the tool and point it to a target directory containing `.pak` files.

### CLI Version
(Coming soon) — Will allow running the tool directly from your terminal with commands like:
```bash
pakseek-cli /path/to/folder
```
