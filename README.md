# PakSeek

PakSeek is a powerful and lightweight PAK file scanning and viewing tool built for OpenSUSE.
This tool allows you to quickly locate `.pak` files in a given directory, inspect their metadata, and prepare for future capabilities like extraction.

## Caution
It's Still Under-Development - Expect a Stable Release Soon

## Features
